fMRIPost-AROMA is a BIDS App for running ICA-AROMA on a preprocessed
fMRI dataset.
It is intended to replace the built-in workflow in fMRIPrep 23.0 and earlier,
but accepts any BIDS derivatives dataset where BOLD images have been resampled
to MNI152NLin6Asym.

***This is currently a placeholder. The workflow still needs to be copied here
and packaged.***
